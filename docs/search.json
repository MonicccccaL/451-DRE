      "contents": "\r\nTable of contents\r\nTo start exploring, please simply navigate to tabs on the upper right corner. We will start by introducing causal inference and motivation behind this project, then diving into mathematical aspect of Doubly Robust Estimator (DRE), and ending up with a simply computation simulation study. Have fun!\r\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to yma1@macalester.edu and xli2@macalester.edu. Thank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
